# OBSERVATIONS:
# - quick observations show that many peak PM2.5 readings occur in Q4 of the year
# - interestingly, some of the lowest readings occur around MAR/APR
# - sharp decrease in PM2.5 readings in MAR 2020 (possibly related to COVID lockdowns?)
# - max PM2.5 reading from SEP-OCT 2020 (coinciding with fires)

# year comparisons of PM2.5
# add additional columns for year and day of the year

# OBSERVATIONS:
# - 2016 has erratic readings during Q1, including both highest and lowest PM2.5 of that year
# - 2017 has peak readings during last two months of year
# - 2018 has peaks around JUL and from DEC-FEB
# - 2019 peaks around OCT, but has noticeably less variation in spikes compared to previous years
# - 2020 has the biggest range, with the lowest of the 5 year readings occurring MAR2020 and the highest occuring SEP2020
# - 2020 has a general trend upwards as year progresses (random walk?)
# majority of PM2.5 readings occur between 50-100

Let's create a time series object for the daily PM2.5 data. 
```{r}
PM2.5 <- ts(
  airquality$PM2.5.AQI.Value,
  start = c(2016, 1), # the series starts on the 1st day of 2016
  frequency = 365.25 # number of days per year, accounting for leap years 
)
PM2.5
```

```{r}
# Augmented Dickey-Fuller test 
adf.test(PM2.5)
```

The p-value is 0.01, so we can reject the null hypothesis that the time series has a unit root in favor of the alternative hypothesis that the time series is stationary. 

```{r}
# Decompose time series into trend, seasonality, and noise 
PM2.5_comps <- decompose(PM2.5)
plot(PM2.5_comps)
```

The ADF test suggested the series is stationary; however, the decomposition reveals an upward trend and annual seasonality. 

```{r}
# ACF and PACF plots (lag=365 selected to represent a year)
acf2(PM2.5, 365.25, main='ACF & PACF')
```

The autocorrelation at lag 1 is very strong. The ACF tails off, while the PACF cuts off after lag 1, which suggests an AR(1) model. Let's try it out. 

```{r}
# AR(1) model 
sarima(PM2.5, p=1, d=0, q=0)
```

There are some problems with this model. The tail ends of the residuals deviate quite significantly from the normal distribution, according to the Q-Q plot. Furthermore, the p values of the Ljung-Box statistic are all under .05, which suggests autocorrelation within the residuals.
